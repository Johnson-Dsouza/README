### **Additional Costs for Each Provider**

When using serverless GPU-based solutions, the hourly rates typically cover only GPU usage. However, additional costs can arise depending on your workload and specific configurations. Below is a detailed breakdown of **additional costs** associated with each provider:

---

#### **1. Azure Machine Learning**
- **Azure Functions Cost**:  
  - Azure Functions, often used to run serverless workloads, are billed separately at **~$0.20 per million executions**.
  - If you are using Azure Machine Learning with Azure Functions for orchestration, this cost needs to be factored in.
  
- **Data Storage**:  
  - Storage for datasets, model checkpoints, and logs is billed according to Azure Storage pricing tiers (e.g., Blob storage, file storage).
  
- **Networking Costs**:  
  - Data egress (data transferred out of Azure regions) is charged separately and varies depending on the volume. For example, the first 5GB/month may be free, but beyond that, costs range from **$0.087/GB** to **$0.05/GB**, depending on the data volume.

- **Other Costs**:  
  - Using additional services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for managing containers and scaling GPU workloads incurs separate charges based on CPU, memory, and node configurations.

#### **2. Runpod**
- **Persistent Storage Costs**:  
  - If your workload requires additional storage, Runpod charges for **persistent storage** or **shared volumes**. For example, 1TB of storage may cost **~$0.06/hour** (varies with location and usage).

- **API Usage**:  
  - Unlike others, **API usage is included** in GPU pricing. However, if additional features or premium support are needed, separate charges might apply.

- **Networking**:  
  - While Runpod doesn't explicitly charge for networking, data egress costs may be added if transferring large datasets out of Runpod-hosted regions.

#### **3. AWS SageMaker**
- **Managed Endpoints**:  
  - SageMaker endpoints are billed at **~$0.0005 per invocation**. For workloads requiring frequent model inference, this cost can scale significantly. For example:
    - **1 million invocations** = **~$500** in endpoint costs.
  
- **Data Storage**:  
  - Input/output storage for models and datasets (stored in S3) incurs separate charges based on AWS S3 pricing (e.g., **$0.023/GB/month** for standard storage).

- **Data Transfer**:  
  - Data egress (outbound data transfer) is charged separately and starts at **$0.09/GB**.
  
- **Other Services**:  
  - SageMaker often works in conjunction with other AWS services (e.g., CloudWatch for monitoring, Step Functions for orchestration), each adding its own cost.

---

#### **4. Google Vertex AI**
- **Managed Endpoints**:  
  - Google charges **~$0.10 per 1,000 predictions** for managed inference endpoints. For workloads with frequent API calls, this can accumulate:
    - **1 million predictions** = **~$100** in endpoint costs.

- **Data Storage**:  
  - Vertex AI uses Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for datasets, model artifacts, and logs. Storage costs range from **$0.02–$0.04/GB/month**, depending on the tier (e.g., Nearline, Coldline).

- **Networking Costs**:  
  - Data transfer between regions and external destinations is billed based on volume. For example:
    - Data egress to the internet starts at **$0.12/GB**.
    - Data transfer between regions within the same continent is typically **$0.01/GB**.

- **Data Preparation and Preprocessing**:  
  - Google Cloud Dataflow or BigQuery, often used with Vertex AI for preprocessing data, have separate pricing that depends on the volume of data processed.

### **Summary of Additional Costs**

| **Cost Type**                  | **Azure Machine Learning**                     | **Runpod**                     | **AWS SageMaker**             | **Google Vertex AI**            |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Storage**                    | Azure Storage costs vary by tier              | Persistent storage billed separately | S3 storage costs: **~$0.023/GB** | GCS storage: **$0.02–$0.04/GB** |
| **Networking**                 | Data egress: **~$0.05–$0.087/GB**             | Data egress may apply          | Data egress: **~$0.09/GB**     | Data egress: **~$0.01–$0.12/GB**|
| **Managed Endpoints/Functions**| Azure Functions: **~$0.20/million executions**| API usage included             | Endpoint: **~$0.0005/invocation** | Endpoint: **~$0.10/1,000 predictions** |
| **Other Costs**                | AKS or container services                     | None noted                     | Monitoring/orchestration add-ons | Preprocessing tools (e.g., Dataflow) |

### **Key Takeaways**:
- **Runpod** minimizes additional costs but may lack enterprise-level features like managed endpoints or orchestration tools.
- **Azure Machine Learning** and **AWS SageMaker** incur higher additional costs due to managed services and integration with cloud ecosystems.
- **Google Vertex AI** strikes a balance between pricing and advanced features, though networking and endpoint costs can scale significantly.
